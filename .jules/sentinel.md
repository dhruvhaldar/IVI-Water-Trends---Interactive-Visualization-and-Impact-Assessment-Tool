## 2024-05-24 - SSRF Protection in API Clients
**Vulnerability:** The API client allowed setting a `base_url` pointing to internal/private IP addresses (including `localhost` and cloud metadata services like `169.254.169.254`), creating a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) risk.
**Learning:** Simply checking the URL scheme (http/https) or string matching 'localhost' is insufficient. DNS resolution is required to inspect the actual target IP address.
**Prevention:** Implement a `validate_base_url` method that resolves the hostname using `socket.getaddrinfo` and checks the resulting IP object (using `ipaddress` library) against `is_private`, `is_loopback`, and `is_reserved`. Allow an explicit override (e.g., `CORE_ALLOW_INTERNAL_IPS`) for legitimate internal use cases.
